# Windows API Code Pack

This repository contains a subset of the Windows API Code Pack (original homepage
no longer online), a set of C# libraries designed to ease integration with some of
the lesser-known features of Windows 7 and later.

Only the core, shell, and shell-extension libraries are contained in this
repository. The DirectX, linguistic services, and sensor libraries
are excluded, due to deprecation (of either the libraries themselves
or their underlying technologies).
